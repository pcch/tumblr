                <h2>Who we are.</h2>
                <p>Campus House is a non-denominational church community in the heart of campus made up of several hundred Purdue students who are seeking what it means to be a follower of Jesus and grow in their faith.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to help each person that walks through our doors pursue an intimate, dynamic relationship with God, and to encourage them to live out the Gospel in every part of their lives.</p>

                <p>1000 State Street, which is at the corner of State &amp; Waldron, across from Lilly Science Building.  Our building is incredibly ugly on the outside so you canâ€™t miss it.</p>
